Finished homework assignment for week 6: The Weather Dashboard

Name: Weekly Weather Website

The objective of this week's assignment was to create a website application that displays a five day forecast weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The application will allow the user to search any given city and have the current and future weather conditions for that city returned on the screen. Each user search will be saved into local storage and be retained in a list for the user to click through and look at whenever they'd like.  

Along with the weather conditions, a UV index will display with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
